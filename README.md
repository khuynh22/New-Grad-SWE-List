# New-Grad-SWE-List

This is a New Grad List API that helps me and all students apply to the most updated New Grad positions for Software Engineer.

To run the project, install **flask** framework, **SendGrid API** and **env** using these following command in the terminal:
<ol>
  <li>`pip install flask`</li>
  <li>`pip install sendgrid`</li>
  <li>`pip install python-dotenv`</li>
</ol>
